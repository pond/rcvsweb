RCVSweb v0.0.2, 06-Aug-2006
===========================

RCVSweb is a Ruby On Rails wrapper around the CVSweb utility. A single
controller with a single action is run for all routes; it maps the
request to CVSweb, setting up the environment for the script so that
the script behaves as if it were running conventionally. The output is
captured, parsed to remove HTML headers and footers, then placed into
a Rails view. This means that CVSweb output can be 'themed' using
Rails layouts and partials. Normal and fast CGI execution is supported.

No database is required by this application. Active Record is not used.

Install the application in the usual manner. Edit config/environment.rb
to specify the location of the application relative to the document
root and the location of the CVSweb script. It is assumed that CVSweb
runs correctly as a normal CGI script - installation and configuration
of CVSweb should be carried out to achieve this. No special changes
need to be made.

The version of CVSweb tested with this release of RCVSweb is 3.0.6 from
the following location:
